Text::NASA_Ames
==================

The Text::NASA_Ames module implements a reader for the NASA Ames File Formats
as described by http://cloud1.arc.nasa.gov/solve/archiv/archive.tutorial.html
The data is read by an iterator, so the memory-consumption is low even on
large files. For simplicity, variable names are the same as described in the
tutorial.
